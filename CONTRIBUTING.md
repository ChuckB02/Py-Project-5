# Welcome to Python-beginner-projects! 🚀

Hey there! Thanks a bunch for thinking about contributing to our project! You rock! Here’s how you can get started with making Python-beginner-projects even cooler. 😎

## Let's Get Rolling! 🛠️

### Fork the Project! 🍴

First things first! Hit that **Fork** button on the top right to make your own copy of the project.
Forking a repository is like making your own copy of someone else's project on GitHub. It allows you to freely experiment, make changes, and contribute without altering the original project.

### Grab Your Copy! 📥

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-beginner-projects.git
cd python-beginner-projects
```
### Stay in Sync! 🔄
For smooth sailing, add the original repo as your upstream. This ensures that your contributions are based on the latest code, and it makes collaboration more efficient by preventing divergence between your fork and the main project.
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects.git
```
### Time to Shine! 🌟
Create a new branch and start coding magic! Remember, no breaking stuff, and make sure to explain your changes well.
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
Now, start making your changes in this branch. It’s your creative space to implement solutions, add features, or squash bugs. Remember, this is your canvas — paint your best code!

### Ready, Set, Commit! 🚀
It's time to stage all the changes you've made. If you want to stage specific files, replace . with the file names. 
```bash
git add .
```
To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reveiwer by:
```bash
git commit -m "Brief and descriptive commit message"
```
Push your changes to the remote repository. This makes your changes visible for creating a pull request.
```bash
git push -u origin branch-Name
```
## Creating a Pull Request
- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.🚀 

- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.🥳 🎉
