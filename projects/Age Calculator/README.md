# Age Calculator

This is a Python program that calculates a person's current age and displays it in years, months, days, and weeks. It takes the user's birthdate as input and calculates the difference between the current date and the birthdate.

## How It Works

1. The program uses the `datetime` module to get the current date and time.

2. It prompts the user to input their birthdate in the format "yyyy-mm-dd."

3. It calculates the difference in days between the current date and the birthdate using the `datetime` objects.

4. The program then converts the age in days into years, months, days, and weeks.

5. Finally, it displays the age in the requested format.

## How to Use

1. Run the program using Python.

2. Enter your birthdate when prompted.

3. The program will calculate your age and display it in years, months, days, and weeks.
