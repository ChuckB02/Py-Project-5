# BIGRAM AUTOCOMPLETE

This is an implementation of an autocomplete feature using bigrams. It uses text processing and frequency-based modeling, specifically bigrams, to provide word suggestions based on a given input. Bigrams are pairs of consecutive words or tokens in a text. This tool assists in text prediction by suggesting the most probable word or phrase to follow the input word.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and use the autocomplete feature:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

```python
python bigram_autocomplete.py
```

4. You will be prompted to insert the training corpus. You can provide a multiline text that represents the language patterns from which autocomplete suggestions will be generated.

5. After inserting the training corpus, the script will ask you to input a starting word.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x, and no external libraries or dependencies beyond the Python standard library are necessary.
