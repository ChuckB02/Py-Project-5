### What are Mean, Median, and Mode?

The Mean is the average of all numbers entered. It is calculated by adding all inputs together and divides by the total number of inputs.

The Median is the middle number. It is calculated by sorting the list from smallest to largest and finding the middle input.

The Mode is the most frequent number. It is calculated by finding the number that appears most frequently in the user input.
